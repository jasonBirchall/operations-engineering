# ADR-006 Require authentication for team reports

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering reports are currently completely public. This means they are limited to public repositories. As a result the do not represent the complete code estate of the MoJ organisation.

## Decision

Require authentication through Auth0 before the reports can be viewed.

## Consequences

Private and internal repositories can be included in the reports, allowing a complete view over the estate.
