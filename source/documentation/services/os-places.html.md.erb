# OS Places

The Ministry of Justice uses [OS Places API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/places/overview) for address and postcode lookup and verification.

## Requesting OS Places API Keys

If you require keys for OS Places API please contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel or [os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk) with the following information:

* Business Area e.g. HMCTS
* Service Name e.g. Apply for Probate Online
* Environment Type e.g. Production

The default product that the key will be issued for is **OS Places API - Capture and Verification**. If you require any [additional products](https://developer.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/home) associated with the key please include that in the request.

You can request as many keys as you require i.e. you may want one per environment type.

All keys issued offer the full functionality of the product, irrespective of whether it is for non-production or production purposes.

Keys will be issued to the requestor via a secure method.

## Cost of OS Places API

There is no cost to service teams for use of the service. Costs are met centrally by Platforms & Architecture.

## Revoking Keys

If an API key is no longer required please contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel or [os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk) for the key to be revoked.

## What if my key gets exposed?

OS Places API keys should be treated like any secret/credential. If exposed please contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel or [os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk) immediately for the key to be revoked and a replacement issued.  

Whilst the API provides data that is already in the public domain, there is the potential for financial risk to the Ministry of Justice should a key be misused.

## Further Support

Full documentation for the API can be found [here](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/places/overview).

If further support from Ordnance Survey is needed please contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel or [os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:os-places-admin@digital.justice.gov.uk), with details for required support, in the first instance so that a ticket can be raised.
