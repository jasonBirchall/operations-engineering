# Checking Domain Activity

## Overview

Before fully decommisioning a domain, it's important to confirm that the domain hasn't been accessed in a set period of time.

To do this, it is possible to create a graphed view of DNS queries for a particular domain using CloudWatch in AWS.

## Finding the ID of the Domain in Question

Before creating a graphed view, we first need to identify the **Hosted Zone ID** of the domain in question.

We will be using 'prisons-service.com' as an example here.

1. Navigate to [Route53](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/home#Dashboard), select the 'Hosted Zones' page in the navigation pane and search for the domain to be decommisioned:

    ![Search Hosted Zone](../../images/check-domain-search-hosted-zone.png)

2. On the right hand side of the results, you will notice the **Hosted Zone ID** - copy this value.

## Creating a Graphed View of the Data

Now we have the Hosted Zone ID, we can check for DNS query activity on that particular domain.

1. Navigate to [CloudWatch](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#home:) on AWS.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Metrics -> All Metrics** and then select the **Route53** tile:

    ![Isolate the Domain in CloudWatch](../../images/check-domain-isolate-domain-cloudwatch.png)

3. From here we can continue to the **Hosted Zone Metrics** page and paste the **Hosted Zone ID** we previously copied.
4. Once the zone has been isolated, we just need to select the checkbox on the left to create our initial view of the data:

![Create Initial Graph](../../images/check-domain-create-initial-graph.png)

## Tweaking the Graph for a Better View

Now we have our initial view of the data, we can navigate to the **Graphed View** tab and tweak the settings for a more informative view. I'd recommend the following settings:

 - Timespan = 3 Months
 - View = Stacked Area
 - Statistic = Sum
 - Period = 6 Hours

You should end up with something like this:

![Create Initial Graph](../../images/check-domain-final-view.png)

These settings are personal preference - the important part is being able to determine that the domain hasn't been hit for an extended period of time.

> The general rule here is that if the domain has been inactive for **1 month**, it should be safe to continue with the decommissioning process.
