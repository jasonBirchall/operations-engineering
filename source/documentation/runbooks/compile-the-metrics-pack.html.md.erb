# Compiling the Operations Engineering Metrics pack

> Note: that whilst this is still mostly a manual process, effort is being made to automate most of this currently.

## Overview

The Operations Engineering team aim to provide a metrics pack as part of their service.

This metrics pack will allow for the following benefits to the team and MoJ:

* A clear indication of where the teams efforts have been placed
* The ability to draw trends over time on the usefulness/quality of the teams services
* Additional data to help cost cutting exercises.

## Metrics

### Slack support channel requests

A large amount of our services/support function is engaged with through the Slack support channel (#ask-operations-engineering).

This metric offers the number of unique requests the channel has had each day for the past 30 days.

#### How to gather the metric

1. Navigate to the GitHub action [Get support channel messages'](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering/actions/workflows/get-support-channel-messages.yml)
2. Press 'Run Workflow'
3. Press 'Run Workflow'
4. Refresh the page and click the top running action
5. Press 'Run Script'
6. Press 'Run python3 scripts/python/get-slack-support-messages.py'
7. The metrics are currently within the printout you can currently see.
