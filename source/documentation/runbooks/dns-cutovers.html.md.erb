# Supporting migrations/DNS cutovers

The purpose of this runbook is to provide guidance and tips when supporting migration projects that involve DNS changes.

## Can we support weekend and out of hours work?

Operations Engineering does not offer any out of hour or weekend support for services. If asked, we should challenge any requests and try to schedule work within normal working hours. 

Under exceptional circumstances, it may be appropriate to support changes out of hours, including weekends to mitigate risks, or due to contractual constraints. In this instance seek approval from the Product Manager or Head of Hosting before agreeing to any scheduling, and let the rest of the team know.

## How should DNS changes be submitted?

Ensure that all required DNS changes are submitted in writing by the requestor to domains@digital.justice.gov.uk.

This should include an supporting runbooks or other documentation.

If there is a bridge call related to the work, please add invite details to the shared Operations Engineering calender for visibility.

## Don't be a hero

DNS changes can cause all sorts of problems. Our DNS estate is large and complex. If something goes wrong, don't be a hero. Ask for help if in hours. If out of hours and there is no one to help it's ok to back changes out. No one will thank you for a critical system being down on a Monday morning.
