# Add New Users to 1Password

These processes are for adding new users to the Ministry of Justice Enterprise LastPass account.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

* Access to [1Password Dashboard](https://ministryofjustice.1password.eu/home)
* New user name and work email address
* Details of the shared Vault that the user needs adding to
* Approval from Vault Owner to add new user

Note - Owner details are stored in the Vault Description field within 1Password

**1Password is only available to MoJ users/teams. We do not give access to 3rd party suppliers or anyone without an @digital.justice.gov, @justice.gov.uk or cica.gov.uk email address.**

**1Password is also only for shared Team credentials. Users must be added to a ["Group"](https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/). If access is just for personal use only, refer then to the [Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp).**

**Note - This is a two step process. A user will be invited to join the orgaisation (create and account, set up 2FA and install app etc). The users will then need to be added to the correct Group to enable access to a shared Vault.**

## Step 1 - Issue invite

1. Login to the 1Password Dashboard

2. Click on the "+" on the invitations section to bring up the box to add the users email address.

3. Add user email address and Click on the "Invite" button to sumbit. You can add multiple users one time. The user will be issued with an invitation email.

** Step 2 - Add user to Group

1. When the user has sucessfully created an account we will receive a notification to #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel. 

2. Click on the link to "confirm" the user can join the MoJ Organisation.
