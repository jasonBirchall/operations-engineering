# Requests for AWS Account Access

Occasionally we are asked by user for access to an existing AWS account.

**Note - We do not create new AWS Accounts. Service Teams should be using either Cloud Platform or Modernisation Platform.**

## Requests for Modernisation Platform access

Direct requester to #ask-modernisation-platform slack channel.

## AWS SSO

The MoJ preferred way to access AWS acount is via [AWS SSO](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/). SSO uses GitHub Teams to set permissions to AWS Accounts.

1. Confirm with the user which the AWS account.

2. Confirm with the AWS Account Owner [see AWS Account List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lZ2ffiN_yQEYqTYnBzTbl16iElfrp3rZ8JnznDQWc-g/edit?usp=sharing) that the requester can have access to that account.

3. If approved, add the user to the appropriate GitHub Team [see team associations](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account/blob/main/management-account/terraform/sso-admin-account-assignments.tf).

4. Confirm to requester when completed and send [AWS SSO link](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/).

## AWS SSO not applicable

Some older AWS accounts are not enrolled in SSO. In those instances direct the requester to the owner of that AWS account.
